# Algorithms
> **My brain banging experiment.**

My background is not computer science, nor anything computer related! Therefore, I am continually striving to improve my understanding and ability of this realm as a pursue and progressively more successful career as a Software Engineer.

I have begun reading this big red algortihm book on several occasions:
<img alt='that big red algorithm book' src="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cover.png" width="200">
and completed the first bunch of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems or spent time playing [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Always with good intentions but my consistency ultimately fails.

## Time for a new approach
Thus this repo, a public face to my personal education. At attempt at leveraging public accountability as an incentive to better myself and remain consistent with my efforts. With luck this will, eventually, serve as an occasionally useful **algorithm and data structure** repository, reference material and reflective log as I improve my understanding.

Enough talk:
